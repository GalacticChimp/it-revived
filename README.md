## Background
This is a hobby project where I explore procedural generation, emergent economies, and goal-based AI

## Goals
Create an interesting and diverse world with some simulation elements, give AI actors unique motivations and behaviors, and allow the player to experience a story formed from these elements

## Features
* Procedural generation of world, cities, languages, and creatures
* Emergent economy formed from traders gathering resources, trading in local markets, and bringing resources between markets
* AI actors which can learn and spread knowledge of events, locations, and other actors

## Dependencies

Required packages 
* pyYaml
* pattern
* matplotlib

## Operating systems
Currently only works for Windows machines.
