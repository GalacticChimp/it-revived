################### AGENT TYPES ####################
# These dicts look up agent info based on the resource or good that the agent produces
#
# Consumed items are consumed each turn, regardless of whether they produce anything..
# Essential items are required in order to do their jobs, but are not consumed (but have a chance of breaking each turn)
# Preferred items are not required to do their jobs, but an agent will still try to purchase them if there are none in inventory
